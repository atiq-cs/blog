<p>This review is based on recent experience with an elderly patient during Octocber 2019.</p>
<p>If you have a complicated disease they have a high chance of wrongly diagnosing and can get you into more trouble. There are not many specialist doctors here.</p>
<p>Some of their machines are old and buggy, might actually do harm than good giving you false indication in report!</p>
<p>They wrongly diagnosis one of our family members and now he is fighting for life in a hospital in Dhaka going through better diagnosis procedure. The doctor who treated the patient is Golam Hossain. I wish they did not put the patient into powerful doses of medication without understanding what would be implication for the disease he has.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is high risk of mis-diagonising a patient in this hospital.</li>
<li>There is dialysis facility. But, guess what, for our patient, they were not able to identify the trouble in Kidney and suggested medicines in a different area.</li>
<li>If admitted in hospital, for older patients, with complications all they do is apply Saline and injections.</li>
<li>A doctor has no desire to see a Patient admitted by another doctor. It's a matter of business. Probably, doctor who admits the patients benefits the most unlike other hospitals and hence, other doctors don't have incentives.</li>
<li>Every doctor want to admit the patient under them and wanna do a bunch of tests and reports whether those are repeat or unnecessary.</li>
<li>They release the admitted patient in a hurry if they feel they won't be able to handle it. A hefty bill is followed, to be paid by patient's family whether patient is cured or not.</li>
<li>They won't be cooperating in providing reports till release, doctors have all those documents in their custody till release.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary,</p>
<ul>
<li>It's an okay Hospital for simple diseases. Don't get admitted just visit doctor in chamber.</li>
<li>Cross check prescriptions with specialists in the disease area.</li>
<li>Don't ever get admitted if you need specialists from multiple areas, they make this really hard and waste time!!</li>
</ul>
